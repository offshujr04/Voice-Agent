## The Problem

Most websites are silent. Visitors land, scroll, and leave.

- **~97% of visitors** bounce without converting.
- **~50% of booked demos** don't show up.
- High-intent questions — *"How much for my use case?"*, *"How is this different from competitor X?"*, *"Does it integrate with my stack?"* — get **no answer in the moment**.
- Marketing pays for the click. Sales chases cold leads. CAC climbs.

The funnel leaks in the middle, exactly where intent is highest and no one is listening.

## What We Built

**VoiceFlow** is a voice AI agent that you embed on your website in 5 minutes via Google Tag Manager. Once installed, it:

| Step | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Listen** | Visitor speaks a question into the widget. |
| **Understand** | Agent parses intent, decides what to do. |
| **Navigate** | Opens the right page, highlights the relevant section. |
| **Speak** | Voices the answer in under a second. |

The agent is **grounded in your own website content** — it never hallucinates pricing or features. It qualifies leads in real time, books demos directly into your calendar, and gracefully hands off to a human when uncertain.

### Sample queries the prototype handles

As an example, we built the demo on [AiSensy](https://aisensy.com)'s website — a real WhatsApp Business platform — to show how it handles real, customer-facing visitor questions:

- *"How much does AiSensy cost for a Shopify store?"* → opens `/pricing`, explains tiers
- *"How is this different from Wati?"* → opens comparison page, gives verdict
- *"Can I take payments on WhatsApp?"* → opens features page, lists integrations
- *"Book me a demo for tomorrow afternoon."* → confirms calendar slot

## The Idea

Voice AI is finally ready: production-grade quality, sub-300ms latency, and roughly 10× cheaper than 18 months ago. **The hard part isn't the voice anymore — it's the interaction layer.**

What makes VoiceFlow different is the bidirectional sync between voice and visual UI: the agent speaks *while* navigating the page, highlights what it's talking about, and reacts to the user interrupting mid-sentence. Off-the-shelf voice SDKs don't do this. We built it.

## Tech Stack

### Voice Pipeline
- **[LiveKit Cloud](https://livekit.io)** — real-time audio transport over WebRTC
- **[Deepgram](https://deepgram.com)** — streaming speech-to-text
- **[OpenAI Agents SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents)** with **GPT-5.5** — reasoning, tool calling, conversation state
- **[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)** — natural-sounding text-to-speech

### Interaction Layer *(our IP)*
- Custom DOM tools for navigation, scrolling, and element highlighting
- Bidirectional voice ⇄ visual sync, sub-second latency
- Voice barge-in (interruption handling) with automatic chat fallback
- Source-page citation on every answer

### Frontend & Infrastructure
- **Next.js** — embedded widget + admin dashboards
- **Supabase** — session storage, conversation logs, lead scoring
- **Vercel** — deployment for both widget and dashboards
- **Google Tag Manager** — one-script install for end customers

## Demo

VoiceFlow is currently in private beta — a public live demo isn't hosted yet. To see the prototype in action:

## Safety & Responsible AI

- Answers are grounded in customer-indexed content only — out-of-scope queries route to human handoff, not free-form generation.
- AI disclosure on widget open, with a clear human-handoff option.
- Customer conversations are not used to train any foundation model.
- Every answer surfaces its source page for verification.
